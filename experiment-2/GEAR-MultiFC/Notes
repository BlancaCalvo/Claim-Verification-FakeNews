I had some issue with torch and cuda, solved with this line: 

pip3 install torch==1.3.1+cu100 torchvision==0.4.2+cu100 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

- Ignore both venv in Project and GEAR-MultiFC. Right one: venv3

- I solved the issue of \r\n with the change_fomat.py, nonetheless, not all datasets are yet passed through that. i.e. dev train snippets
